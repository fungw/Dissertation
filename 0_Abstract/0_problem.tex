This dissertation focuses on evaluating \ac{VANET} in Dublin. More specifically, the goal is to investigate whether \ac{VANET} is able to assist with the dissemination of parking data within a small scale city like Dublin. Parking data allows drivers know where vacant parking spaces are at any given time. However, there are potential problems regarding making parking space information public. One of the main concepts for the introduction of smart parking systems is to minimise traffic congestion within an urban area. By making the parking information public, it does not guarantee that traffic congestion and/or traffic emissions would decrease. Drivers may run into scenarios where they are en-route to a vacant parking spot, only to find that the space has been taken seconds before they arrive. There is a need for a backend system that oversees the parking spaces, coordinates with cars, road side units, or other traffic systems in order to fully take advantage of the real-time parking data. Smart parking may be broken down in two distinct areas. One being the utilisation of sensors to locate parking space occupancies. And the other is the dissemination of the sensed parking data to the relevant users. While the dissertation focuses on the dissemination of data within Dublin, various sensory techniques will also be explored.\\
