In this section, the results obtained from the simulation efforts are analysed. \ac{VEINS} includes an emission model for calculating the emissions per vehicle during the simulation progress. The emissions are based on this study \citep{Cappiello2002AConsumption}. The study was performed on two specific vehicles, a 1994 Dodge Spirit and a 1992 Suzuki Swift. The emissions from this study are extracted and integrated into the emissions model by \ac{VEINS}. This emissions model is used for the output of the simulations in this dissertation.

The evaluation processes takes two runs. One for the baseline and the second with a VANET smart parking system.
