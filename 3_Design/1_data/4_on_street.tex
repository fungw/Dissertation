\subsection{Dublin On-Street Parking Data}\label{ssec:on-street_parking_data}
Dublin on-street parking data involves obtaining the average park times of Dublin drivers within the city. ParkingTag is the on-street parking space operator for Dublin. A data dump of 30 anonymous drivers throughout the year of 2016 was provided from ParkingTag. The data dump includes the price that each driver paid as well as the zones that the drivers parked in. These zones are the same zones listed on figure \ref{fig:DUBLINZONES}.

The price to park in the yellow zone is €2.90, and red zones are €2.40. Given the price paid by a driver, their time duration spent parked can be calculated. This data is used to determine how long a driver is parked for during the simulation. A subset of the parking tag data provided by ParkingTag can be found in Appendix C.
