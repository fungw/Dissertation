\subsection{Dublin Traffic Flows} \label{ssec:traffic_flows}
Dublin City traffic flow is incorporated into the simulation to build a realistic model.

A visit was made to the Dublin City Councils' traffic department to obtain this data. In most major junctions in Dublin, inductive loops are embedded beneath the ground just before the junctions' traffic lights. The sensor can detect whether a vehicle is above it. The sensor also acts as a counter, thus recording the amount of traffic that passes a particular lane on the road. 

On some roads, there is a secondary sensor embedded into the ground further along the road. If there is a stationary vehicle detected above the secondary sensor, the traffic control station knows that that particular road segment has a traffic queue. At the time of writing, \ac{DCC} traffic control centre does not have a sophisticated self-optimising traffic queue management system.

The obtained traffic flow data contains hourly intervals of the number of vehicles that have passed the junctions. The time interval of the data is from January 2016 through to December 2016. A subset of the data can be found in Appendix A.

Table \ref{table:trafficflow} lists the roads that Dublin traffic flow data is recorded from, along with their national road identifier. The areas that they originate from are also included.
