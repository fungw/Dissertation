\section{Motivation}
One of the core motivation behind smart parking is to minimise the amount of drivers driving around looking for a vacant parking spot within a city. By minimising the process of looking for parking spaces, it will have a positive effect on the environment, as there will be less vehicles on the road and less vehicle emissions. This is also advantageous in terms of traffic congestion in an urban setting, with fewer vehicles on the road, traffic levels may be alleviated. In a study by Donald Shoup \citep{Shoup2006CruisingParking}, ``Between 8 and 74 percent of the traffic was cruising for parking, and the average time to find a curb space ranged between 3.5 and 14 min".

Minimising the amount of drivers driving around looking for a vacant parking spot can be achieved in different ways. One of the methods in achieving this is to introduce parking sensors in parking locations. The parking sensors will be able to sense if a parking spot is vacant or not. This parking data may be disseminated to all drivers. However, by surfacing the parking information to drivers, it does not guarantee that a driver will get a parking spot. In other words, drivers will still need to cruise for parking spots. For this reason, smart parking could potentially be improved upon.

Parking data dissemination methods is a considerable aspect on improving a smart parking system. Parking data dissemination explores how parking data should be made available to drivers. In this paper \citep{Verroios2011ReachingNetworking}, various data dissemination techniques are explored. The paper proposes three ways in which parking data could be disseminated. The ``live" approach is one of the three data dissemination techniques. It proposes inter-vehicles communications regarding parking space availabilities. This introduces the concept of \ac{VANET}.

\ac{VANET} is the introduction of vehicular communications. There are various \ac{VANET} models; vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I), vehicle-to-device (V2D), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G). The \ac{VANET} model of interest in this dissertation is vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V). There are various motivations for \ac{VANET}, some of those included are vehicle platooning, and forward collision mitigation. Vehicle platooning involves vehicles sharing their current speed, acceleration and positioning information with other vehicles within their vicinity. By doing so, vehicles may move in a more streamline motion along a street. In this Japanese study conducted in 2008 \citep{Sugiyamal2008TrafficJam}, one of the reasons of traffic build up is due to a small fluctuation in the speed of an individual vehicle. The study was able to recreate a traffic jam that produced a ``shockwave" effect down the street, similar to a traffic jam in the real world. With the introduction of inter-vehicular communication, cars may be able to keep the flow of traffic in constant manner, thus avoiding unnecessary traffic congestions. Forward collision may assist drivers in times of traffic accidents. Information regarding an accident that occurred on a street may be propagated back along the road through vehicles on that street. Vehicles further along the street may be able to make alternative routes to their destinations to alleviate traffic in that area.

Additionally, as self driving vehicles are becoming increasingly popular, \ac{VANET} and vehicular cloud networking has become more and more likely. As outlined in \citep{Gerla2014InternetClouds}, the next step in evolution is just around the corner: The Internet of Autonomous Vehicles.

This dissertation involves designing a \ac{VANET} smart parking system. More specifically, a simulation of a \ac{VANET} based smart parking system will be evaluated on the city of Dublin. Dublin traffic and parking data will be incorporated into the simulation to provide a realistic simulation model.
