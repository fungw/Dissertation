\section{Research Question}
The research question that this dissertation poses to answer is whether a \ac{VANET} incorporated smart parking system is beneficial to a small scale city like Dublin City. This involves questions regarding whether a \ac{VANET} smart parking system would minimise the number of drivers cruising looking for parking spots. Evaluation metrics includes the amount of CO2 emission reductions if any, and the number of drivers that arrive at a destined parking location to find that it has just been occupied.
