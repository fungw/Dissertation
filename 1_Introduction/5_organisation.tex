Chapter two gives an in-depth analysis of the current state-of-the-art of smart parking. This involves a literature review on the current \ac{VANET} technologies, parking data dissemination techniques, security and privacy considerations, smart parking models and 
an assessment on smart parking solutions in other cities. Chapter three outlines the design considerations prior to the implementation of the simulation model. The process of obtaining the required traffic and parking data, as well as simulation software considerations. Chapter four discusses the implementation process of the chosen simulation model. Chapter five details the evaluation process and an analysis of the results. Further considerations on future evaluations are put forward. This is followed by the final chapter, chapter six explores possible future works and a conclusion to this dissertation.
