The structure of the dissertation is split into six chapters. This organisation section concludes the introductory chapter. Chapter two gives an in-depth analysis of the current state-of-the-art of smart parking. This involves a literature review on the current \ac{VANET} technologies, parking space sensing technologies, parking data dissemination techniques, security and privacy considerations, smart parking models and an assessment of smart parking solutions in other cities. Chapter three outlines the design considerations before the implementation of the simulation model. The process of obtaining the required traffic and parking data, as well as simulation software reviews. Chapter four discusses the implementation process of the chosen simulation overview. Chapter five details the evaluation process and an analysis of the results. This is followed by the final chapter; Chapter six explores possible future works and a conclusion to this dissertation.
