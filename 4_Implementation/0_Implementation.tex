In this chapter, the implementation process is explained in detail. The initial section explains the process of acquiring a suitable road network representation of Dublin City. This is followed by a section on the generation of traffic flow through tools supplied by \ac{SUMO}. The third section details the various datasets that have been extracted and their role in the simulation. The final section features a thorough explanation of the implementation of a \ac{VANET} smart parking model for the simulation.
