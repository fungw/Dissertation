\subsubsection*{Laser Scanners}
Laser range finders are used to detect the distances from a source point into the distance. In a Japanese research paper, a vehicle with laser range finders attached to the side of vehicle makes an attempt to detect parking space occupancies \citep{ono_probe_2002}. The laser scanners are able to retrieve depth information from the side of the car to the buildings. With a known location of parking spaces, it would be able to analyse the laser distance between the vehicle to the side of the street. At times, the detection of black vehicles go unnoticed. Thus, this paper has devised two algorithms in further enhance the analysis of the resultant depth image acquired through the laser range finder. They are known as the height-curve method and the depth-curve method. Through the use of both methods, the study concludes that it provides an accurate solution for the detection of parking space occupancies with a laser range finder.
