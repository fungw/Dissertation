\subsubsection*{Optical Fibre}
Optical fibres can be used as load sensors to measure the weight of vehicles. A proposal for vehicle detection with optical fibres is explored in this paper \citep{gupta_automated_2016}. The study uses phase-shift and amplitude analysis on the propagation of the optical fibre path in order to detect when a vehicles' wheel is on it. The results show that optical fibres produce a high accuracy rating in the detection of vehicles. The detection of a vehicle could prove useful for parking space occupancy sensing. By placing optical fibres at the entrances and exits of parking lots, they may be able to accurately detect how many vehicles are in the parking lot at any given time.
