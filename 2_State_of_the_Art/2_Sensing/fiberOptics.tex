\subsubsection*{Optical Fibre}
Optical fibres can be used as load sensors to measure the weight of vehicles. A proposal for vehicle detection with optical fibres is explored in this paper \citep{gupta_automated_2016}. The study uses phase-shift and amplitude analysis on the propagation of the optical fibre path to detect when a vehicles' is on it. The results show that optical fibres produce a high accuracy rating for the detection of vehicles. The detection of individual vehicles could be useful by placing optical fibres at the entrances and exits of parking lots; they may be able to accurately record how many vehicles are in the parking lot at any given time. Additionally, optical fibres may be placed at both ends of a one-way street that contains on-street parking locations. This could provide information regarding some parking spaces on that street by finding the difference between the vehicles that have entered the street but have not exited on the other end.
