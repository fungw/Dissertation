\subsection{Parking Data Sensing}
There are various tradeoffs to be considered as well as the applicability of the sensors for different scenarios. An analysis of each sensor is provided along with a brief conclusion regarding the sensors applicability to sense parking spaces. Figure \ref{table:sensor_description} provides a brief overview of the sensors to be discussed.

        \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l|p{10cm}}
            \textbf{Sensor Technology} & \textbf{Use in Parking Space Detection} \\
            \hline
            Accelerometer & Accelerometers in phones can be used to detect whether a driver has taken a parking space \\ \hline
            Acoustic & Analysis of sound waves of the vehicles to track where vehicles park within a parking lot \\ \hline
            Computer Vision & Utilisation of public CCTV or private parking lot cameras to track vehicles \\ \hline
            Crowdsensing & Pooling of information from participating drivers to detect parking space occupancies \\ \hline
            Laser Range Finders & Scanning on-street locations for parking space occupancies \\ \hline
            Magnetometer & Magnetometers in mobile phones to detect parked vehicles \\ \hline
            Optical Fibre & Detection of vehicles that cross an optical cable. Placement can be at the entrances and exits of parking lots \\ \hline
            \ac{RFID} & \ac{RFID} readers to scan vehicles' \ac{RFID} tags upon entry to parking lots \\ \hline
            Ultrasonic & Emits sound waves at a known location to detect if parking space is occupied \\
