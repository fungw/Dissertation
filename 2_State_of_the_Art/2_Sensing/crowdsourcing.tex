\subsubsection*{Crowdsensing}
ParkJam \citep{Kopeck2012PARKJAM:Demo} is a proposal for a crowdsensing parking space app. It uses publicly available geographic data to get parking areas. The app relies on participating users to submit information regarding parking space availabilities. Incentives for users to participate in updating the parking spaces is that they will receive information regarding vacant parking space in return. However, the paper mentions that further incentives is included in its future works.
