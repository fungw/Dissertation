\subsubsection*{Ultrasonic}
Ultrasonic sensors are widely used to sense parking space occupancies. The largest shopping centre in Ireland, located in Dundrum, serves more than 3,500 spaces. Above every parking space in the underground parking lot is an ultrasonic sensor. The ultrasonic sensors are used to sense the occupancy of an individual parking space, and the information is relayed to electronic display boards both inside and outside the parking lot. Parking information signs inside the parking lot guide drivers up and down levels and in between aisles \citep{2008BAY-SPECIFICCENTRE}. 

Similarly, in this paper \citep{Kianpisheh2012SmartDetector}, ultrasonic sensors are placed above parking spaces within a parking lot. The proposed \ac{SPS} is able to use the ultrasonic sensors to detect improper parking as well as parking space occupancy detection. In the same way, the \ac{SPS} relays information to the information display boards to inform drivers of the current parking space occupancies in the area.
