\subsubsection*{Ultrasonic}
Ultrasonic sensors are widely used to sense parking space occupancies. The largest shopping centre in Ireland, located in Dundrum, serves more than 3,500 spaces. Above every parking space in the underground parking lot is an ultrasonic sensor. The ultrasonic sensors are used to sense the occupancy of an individual parking space, and the information is relayed to electronic display boards both inside and outside the parking lot. Parking information signs inside the parking lot guide drivers up and down levels and in between aisles \citep{2008Bay-SpecificCentre}. While external electronic display boards guide drivers to different parking lots.

Similarly, in this paper \citep{Kianpisheh2012SmartDetector}, ultrasonic sensors are placed above parking spaces within a parking lot. The proposed smart parking system is able to use the ultrasonic sensors to detect improper parking as well as parking space occupancy detection. In the same way, the smart parking system relays information to the information display boards to inform drivers of the current parking space occupancies in the area.

The use of ultrasonic sensors are highly accurate and the cost of each individual sensor is relatively cheap \citep{dokur_embedded_2016}. It is also worth noting that since ultrasonic sensors do not support multiple detection of vehicles, the cost of deployment could become much more.
