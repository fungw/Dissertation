\subsubsection*{Acoustic}
Acoustic sensors are able to detect the noise emitted from vehicle alarms as well as vehicle engine sounds. A solution is proposed to utilise low-cost acoustic sensors to detect a vehicles within a parking lot environment \citep{Na2009AcousticSystem}. An acoustic localisation algorithm is introduced to narrow the scope of where it estimates the vehicle has parked. In a parking lot scenario, it assumes that cameras are available. Thus, by re-positioning the cameras' viewing angle towards the localised area, the parking lot system is able to confirm whether the parking spot has been occupied.

Acoustic sensors are very sensitive to the environment they operate in. Although this paper \citep{Lee2008IntelligentNetworks} does not directly focus on the analysis of an acoustic sensor parking space detector, it mentions a possible solution that is worth considering. The paper states that each vehicle has its own characteristics, vehicle size, magnetic wave pattern and engine sound. With the combination of magnetometers, ultrasonic sensors and acoustic sensors placed at the entrance of a parking lot. It could build a database of the vehicles entering the parking lot, recording the vehicles' body shape, magnetic wave pattern and engine sounds with the above mentioned sensors. With the placement of sensors throughout the parking lot, it may be possible to localise where a specific vehicle has parked, thus supplying information as to where a vehicle has taken up a parking spot.
