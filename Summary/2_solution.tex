The goal of this dissertation is to evaluate VANET integration with smart parking facilities. The solution involves simulation of the Dublin road network with \ac{VEINS}. This software package couples \ac{SUMO}, a microscopic traffic simulator, and \ac{OMNeT++}, a discrete event simulator. Dublin traffic volumes and parking data will be factored into the evaluation process to provide a realistic simulator model.\\
